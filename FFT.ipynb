Numerically, the data corresponding to $x(t)$ will be given as a series of points, not continuous values.

(The reason for this repetition is discussed later in PX2232, but is proved by multiplying $x(t)$ in equation (Eq. [1](#mjx-eqn-eq:1)) by a periodic series of Dirac delta functions, then Fourier transforming.)\n",

It’s not just that we would miss out on the higher frequency components that might be of interest - if higher frequencies are present in the pre-sampled signal, they actually appear in the transformed signal in the wrong place: this is known as _aliasing_. (In experiments, data is usually sampled after the signal goes through an analog _anti-aliasing filter_ to remove these higher frequencies.)\n",

This has the effect of broadening otherwise infinitely sharp peaks, unless $\\tau$ happens to match exactly the period of the underlying signal(s). (The reason for this is again discussed in PX2232. The proof is based on multiplying $x(t)$ in equation (Eq. [1](#mjx-eqn-eq:1)) by a top-hat function, and considering a ‘convolution’ in frequency space.)\n",

The maths becomes far simpler if let the $x$ data itself repeat periodically outside this window, since this results in a Fourier _series_. In other words, only certain discrete frequencies are needed to represent the original signal if we use this assumption. The frequencies are all multiples of the $1/\\tau$, so the point separation in frequency space is $\\Delta f = 1/\\tau$. This is also illustrated, in figure 2(e).\n",
